### Step 1) 
The main file is getOptASRparam.m in which you define the file names and the location; and you define the ASR parameters (cut-off = k, Mode = ASR removal or correction). 

### Step 2) 
Open evalASRparams.m and define your measure of interest to evaluate the performance of ASR. For example, SNR or FTR for frequency-tagging analysis (Buiatti et al., 2019), SME for ERP analysis (Luck et al., 2021). (Remember to use EEG1 for extracting this measure and not EEG!)

### Step 3) 
Run getOptASRparam and the results can be found in a table variable T.
